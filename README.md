# WallFit – 3D Print Wall Thickness Optimizer
### WallFit is a simple tool that helps 3D modelers calculate optimal wall thicknesses for 3D printing. It ensures that the selected wall thickness results in a whole number of extrusion passes, improving print quality and minimizing print time.

## 🚀 Features
- Select your printer's nozzle width (e.g. 0.4 mm)
- Input your desired wall thickness
- Get the nearest optimal thickness that ensures a whole number of passes
- Optimize model design for better print performance

## 🧠 Why use WallFit?
When designing 3D printable parts, using arbitrary wall thicknesses can lead to poor print quality and inefficient slicing. WallFit helps you find a thickness that matches the printer's capabilities—no more incomplete outer walls or unnecessary inner gaps.

**For example:**

-Desired thickness: 1.1 mm \
-Nozzle width: 0.4 mm \
-Suggested thickness: 1.2 mm → 3 full passes of 0.4 mm
